- **What is the purpose of ato-do-list**

The purpose of a to-do list is to keep track of tasks that need to be completed. It helps individuals or teams organize their work and prioritize their tasks by providing a clear list of things that need to be done. A to-do list can be used for personal tasks, such as grocery shopping or completing household chores, or for work-related tasks, such as completing a project or meeting a deadline. It can also help reduce stress and anxiety by providing a sense of accomplishment as tasks are completed and crossed off the list. Overall, a to-do list is an effective tool for improving productivity, time management, and overall organization.
